[server.js](/server.js) starts an HTTP/2 server (with self-signed certificates) that always responds using mixed multipart **without** the `Transfer-Encoding` header. Then [whatwg-node.test.ts](/whatwg-node.test.ts) tests whether [@whatwg-node/fetch](https://github.com/ardatan/whatwg-node/tree/master/packages/fetch) works. It doesn't.
